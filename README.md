Event Hub is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to create, discover, and interact with community events. The platform serves as a centralized hub where users can post events and receive feedback from other users who attend or view those events.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of Event Hub is to simplify event discovery and management while encouraging community interaction. It allows event organizers to share event details and receive ratings and comments, helping future users decide which events to attend.

## Target Users

Event Hub is intended for students, community members, and event organizers who want a simple platform to post and explore events.

## Core Features

- View a list of all available events
- View detailed information for a single event
- Create new events
- Edit or delete existing events
- Leave feedback on events
- View feedback left by other users

## User Interaction Flow

When users visit the application, they are presented with a list of upcoming events. Selecting an event displays its full details along with feedback from other users. Users can create new events using a validated form, and event creators can update or remove their events. Any user can leave feedback in the form of ratings and comments.

## Conclusion

Event Hub demonstrates core full-stack development concepts including relational databases, API communication, form validation, and CRUD operations. It is a scalable and portfolio-ready project suitable for demonstrating real-world development skills.
